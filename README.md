# hey there, im lenowac 👋

**I dropped out of my computer science degree because I genuinely hate coding.**   
Still doing it because im annoyed by adverts and the thought that personal interactions are tracked + analyzed is displeasing.

### 🌌 Currently 
I'm working towards not nuking my servers shitty configs again, all while trying to study. 
Recently I decided to [blog](https://blog.decided.to) and [note](https://note.decided.to) things in public.

### 🪐 Previously 
I did commit some shit code and dealt excessively with WordPress.

<details> <summary>Details</summary>
When facing badly maintained Windows images on a regular basis, I wrote <a href="https://github.com/lenowac/QuickInstaller">QuickInstaller</a> to make using those computers less painful for everyone.   
  
I've also been guilty of writing shitty, unperformant C# + WinForms Applications (which you dont get to see), although it was good enough to pass exams.   

Using Asana was a major pain for me, partly because didn't have a simple desktop wrapper for AGES. So I compiled <a href="https://github.com/lenowac/AsanaDesktop">my own one</a>. Recently I saw they finally did it.   
  
Since two years I have worked intensely with WordPress for various businesses and non-profits. Planning, starting, moving and fixing installations is no problem as long as the amount of SQL and PHP involved isn't displeasing.   
  
More recently I've entered selfhosting and hosting others with mild success, I know enought ubuntu, debian and docker(-compose) to get something stable.

Besides "computer stuff" I do graphic design work, photography & photojournalism, make music, like reading and love cats.   
I also enjoy a good conversation :)
